## About me

Hello! I am currently studying Information Systems at Faculdade Facimp Wyden. Although I haven't landed my first job in development yet, I'm excited to share a little about myself and my skills.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: C#
- Development: Web back-end on the .NET platform

## Academic experience
Studying for a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems at Faculdade Facimp - Wyden (expected completion: 2024)

My main goal is to be able to develop and use my skills as a web software developer to help make the lives of those around me easier.
I'm looking forward to entering the professional world of **back-end web** development with **C# and .NET**. If you have opportunities, interesting projects or just want to talk about development, don't hesitate to contact me! I'm always looking to learn something new.
